== Introduction

As part of this workshop, we will see how to develop cloud-native microservices using Jakarta EE and MicroProfile, that are deployed using Docker, Kubernetes, and Istio.
We'll examine the basics of modern Enterprise Java services, as well as scalability, resiliency, observability, traffic routing, configuration.


=== Example application

Our microservices example consists of two services, _coffee-shop_ and _barista_ which are both developed as enterprise applications using Jakarta EE and MicroProfile.
Both services are developed and deployed individually; they communicate via HTTP (REST) and are not further coupled, logically nor technologically.

The applications are deployed to Open Liberty, an open-source application server that supports a huge variety of Enterprise Java technologies, including Jakarta EE and MicroProfile.


=== Getting started

To get started, clone the Git repository and use the projects that are provided inside:

----
git clone https://github.com/agavrin/cloud-native-workshop-2021
cd cloud-native-workshop-*/
----


=== Building

In order to build our applications, we issue the following Maven command

Our applications are built using Maven.
Both microservice projects contains a `pom.xml` file, which defines the project build configuration and dependencies.

To begin, we build both microservice applications by navigating to the corresponding directories and issuing the Maven build command:

----
cd ~/cloud-native-workshop*

cd coffee-shop/
mvn package

cd ../barista/
mvn package
----

These commands will build both applications using Maven's `package` phase which creates the deployment artifacts, the WAR files containing our applications, under the corresponding `target` directories.
Take a moment to have a look at the `pom.xml` files and the resulting WAR files, `coffee-shop.war` and `barista.war`.
These WAR files will be deployed to our application containers.


=== Running

In order to run our applications, we could deploy them to (locally) running application containers.
However, since we aim to run in a cloud-native setting, we will deploy the applications as Linux containers, here using Docker.

In order to run Docker containers, we need to create corresponding Docker images, which contain everything that our applications need to just start-up and run.

Let's see how we can achieve that in the link:02-docker.adoc[next section].
