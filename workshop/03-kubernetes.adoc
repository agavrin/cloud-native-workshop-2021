== Kubernetes

In order to run our applications on a Kubernetes cluster, we will need to create a few resources.
Ultimately, we define our environment declaratively, using Infrastructure-as-Code, similar to what we did using the `Dockerfile` files, but this time for the whole environment.
Thus, we want to define how many replicas of our individual application images we want to run, how they are connected and configured, etc.
All of that as code which should reside in our project.

Let's examine the resources we need to create.

=== Pods

A pod is the atomic workload inside Kubernetes clusters.
It is an abstraction over our application instance and contains _usually_ a single container.
That is, that the Docker containers we had in the last part will now run inside Kubernetes pods, one pod per container instance.
If we want to have multiple replicas of our applications, we create multiple pods.

For your information, the following shows a snippet of a YAML pod definition.
This is not something that we create yet, but make sure that you can follow along the semantics of the definitions.

[source,yaml]
----
# ...
metadata:
  labels:
    app: coffee-shop
spec:
  containers:
  - name: coffee-shop
    image: de.icr.io/cee-<your-name>-workshop/coffee-shop:1
    ports:
    - containerPort: 9080
  restartPolicy: Always
# ...
----

The snippet defines the specification of one pod that should contain a single container which is created from our coffee-shop Docker image.

Kubernetes pods are mortal and once they terminate, they are usually not re-started, but recreated.
To make sure that we don't have to recreate the pod resources manually, we use controllers that manage a desired number of pod replicas for us, here Kubernetes deployments.

=== Deployments

We create a Kubernetes deployment that manages one or more replicas of our microservices for us.
Have a look at the following Kubernetes deployment definition:

[source,yaml]
----
kind: Deployment
apiVersion: apps/v1
metadata:
  name: coffee-shop
spec:
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: coffee-shop
      version: v1
  replicas: 1
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: coffee-shop
        version: v1
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: coffee-shop
        image: de.icr.io/cee-$NAME-workshop/coffee-shop:1
        ports:
        - containerPort: 9080
----

This definition looks similar to the pod snippet before, but it encapsulates the pod as a template, from which it'll create the pod replicas.
The deployment will ensure that the desired number of replicas will be met.
If a pod is terminated, whether deliberately or not, the deployment will automatically create a replacement, that is a new pod.

If we want to scale our application, change the deployment definition in another way, or deploy a different version (that is Docker image), we simply change the YAML definition and update it against the cluster.
Kubernetes will try to make sure that the new changes will be reflected, while keeping the disruption minimal.
It ships with zero-downtime deployment support out of the box.


==== Life cycle &amp; probes

A pod that contains a Java application will need a few moments to be fully up-and-running.
Since Kubernetes has no knowledge of the contents of the running container it could only assume that running pods are immediately able to handle traffic.
However, that is not the case and therefore we need to signal once a container is ready to do some meaningful work.

For that reason, we include liveness and readiness probes into our deployment definition.

A liveness probe tells Kubernetes whether the whole pod (for us the application server) is still running.
If that is not the case, Kubernetes will immediately terminate and replace it.
A readiness probe indicates whether the pod is ready to do some work, that is, handle traffic.

There are multiple types of https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/pod-lifecycle/#container-probes[container probes^].
We use an exec action which can execute an arbitrary binary inside the container.
The `curl` commands will connect to the application servers, and the health check resources, respectively.

Now, have a look at the resulting deployment definition (repeat the same for coffee-shop and barista):

[source,yaml]
----
cd coffee-shop/deployment

export APPNAME=coffee-shop
cat <<EOF >>$APPNAME.yaml
kind: Deployment
apiVersion: apps/v1
metadata:
  name: $APPNAME
spec:
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: $APPNAME
      version: v1
  replicas: 1
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: $APPNAME
        version: v1
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: $APPNAME
        image: de.icr.io/cee-$NAME-workshop/$APPNAME:1
        ports:
        - containerPort: 9080
        livenessProbe:
          exec:
            command: ["sh", "-c", "curl -f http://localhost:9080/"]
          initialDelaySeconds: 20
        readinessProbe:
          exec:
            command: ["sh", "-c", "curl -s http://localhost:9080/health | grep -q $APPNAME"]
          initialDelaySeconds: 40
EOF
----

We create YAML files with this content under the `deployment/` folders of both microservice projects.
One deployment will be called `coffee-shop`, like the one displayed, and the other one `barista`.
Make sure that all names, labels, image, and URL declarations are correct.

Now, we finally want to create these resources in our Kubernetes cluster.
We simply apply the files with the `kubectl apply` command:

----
kubectl apply -f coffee-shop/deployment/
kubectl apply -f barista/deployment/
----

The command will apply, that is create or update, all resources that resides under the corresponding directory.

You can check whether the resources have been created successfully, by querying the current deployments and pods:

----
kubectl get pods
kubectl get deployments
----

After a short startup phase, you should see two pods, one for coffee-shop and one for barista, that are ready, i.e. `READY: ... 1/1`.

Now our two applications apparently are running in the cloud, but how to connect to them?


=== Services

A Kubernetes service is a logical abstraction over "`applications`" (whatever these are) and the replicas of these.
Services are single points of entry when we want to connect to our microservices.
They act like load balancers and transparently distribute the requests to the individual pods.

Inside clusters, services are resolvable via a cluster-internal virtual IP address and via DNS by their name.
The latter enables us to simply connect to host names such as `barista`, if a service `barista` exists within the cluster.

Let's have a look at the coffee-shop service definition (you will have to create two services - for coffee-shop and barista):

----
export APPNAME=coffee-shop
cat <<EOF >$APPNAME-service.yaml
kind: Service
apiVersion: v1
metadata:
  name: $APPNAME
  labels:
    app: $APPNAME
spec:
  selector:
    app: $APPNAME
  ports:
    - port: 9080
      name: http
  type: NodePort
EOF
----

The service resource only defines a name, some meta data labels, and where to route traffic to: all pods that match the given selector.
If you have a look at our deployment definitions again, you will see that all pods define an identical `app` label.
This is the connection how the services know, which pods to distribute the requests to.
This service will connect to all pods with label `app: coffee-shop` via port `9080`.
Furthermore, services only connect to pods which are ready.

Now, we create YAML definitions for the coffee-shop and barista services, also under the `deployment/` directories.
You can either create a new file alongside the deployment definition, or put all Kubernetes resources in a single YAML file, with the resources (that is, YAML objects) being separated by a line of three dashes (`---`).
Again, make sure that the name, label, and selector definition match either the coffee-shop or barista application.

We create these resources on the cluster as well, by issuing the same commands like before:

----
kubectl apply -f coffee-shop/deployment/
kubectl apply -f barista/deployment/
----

This is the nice story about declarative Infrastructure-as-Code files: we specify the desired state, and let Kubernetes _apply_ the definitions against the cluster.
Our directories now contain the service definitions, as well.

You can now verify whether the services have been created correctly:

----
kubectl get services
----


=== Accessing our applications

Now, we will connect to our coffee-shop application from outside the cluster.

If we have created a lite cluster we have to connect to our application via the IP address of the (only) node and the node port of the service.
Therefore, we retrieve the public IP address of our cluster:

----
ibmcloud ks workers --cluster mycluster-free
ID         Public IP       Private IP      Machine Type   State    Status   Zone    Version
kube-xxx   159.122.186.7   10.144.188.64   free           normal   Ready    mil01   1.10.12_1541
----

And the node port of our coffee-shop application:

----
kubectl get service coffee-shop
NAME          TYPE       CLUSTER-IP      EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)          AGE
coffee-shop   NodePort   172.21.23.149   <none>        9080:30995/TCP   2m
----

With the example details, we can access our coffee-shop application using the URL `159.122.186.7:30995`, by combining the public IP address and the node port of the service:

----
export URL=159.122.186.7:30995
curl $URL/coffee-shop/resources/orders -i -XPOST \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"type":"Espresso"}'
----

NOTE: If you have created a standard cluster, you can use a Kubernetes ingress resources.
However, in this workshop, we'll focus on Istio networking and thus will demonstrate Istio gateway resources instead (part of the next section).


==== Kubernetes Config Maps

We can define environment variables directly in Kubernetes deployment definitions, or configure them in so called config maps.
A config map is a Kubernetes resources that stores configuration properties in the cluster.
It can be mapped to files or, as in our example, environment variables.

We create the following Kubernetes YAML definition:

[source,yaml]
----
cat <<EOF >>configmap.yaml
kind: ConfigMap
apiVersion: v1
metadata:
  name: coffee-config
data:
  location: Russia
EOF
----

This defines the config map `coffee-config`, which contains the property `location` with the value `Russia`.

In order to make that property available to the running pods later on, we include the value in our Kubernetes deployment definition:

[source,yaml]
----
export APPNAME=coffee-shop
cat <<EOF >$APPNAME.yaml
kind: Deployment
apiVersion: apps/v1
metadata:
  name: $APPNAME
spec:
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: $APPNAME
      version: v1
  replicas: 1
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: $APPNAME
        version: v1
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: $APPNAME
        image: de.icr.io/cee-$NAME-workshop/$APPNAME:1
        ports:
        - containerPort: 9080
        env:
        - name: location
          valueFrom:
            configMapKeyRef:
              name: coffee-config
              key: location
        livenessProbe:
          exec:
            command: ["sh", "-c", "curl -f http://localhost:9080/"]
          initialDelaySeconds: 20
        readinessProbe:
          exec:
            command: ["sh", "-c", "curl -s http://localhost:9080/health | grep -q $APPNAME"]
          initialDelaySeconds: 40
EOF
----

The above example maps the config map values to environment variables in the pods.
As MicroProfile Config ships with a default config source for environment variables, this property will automatically be available to our application.
Thus, the injected value for the `location` will be the enum value `Russia`.

You can have a look at the coffee order locations under the resource for single coffee orders.
You retrieve the URL of a single coffee order from the response of all orders:

----
curl $URL/coffee-shop/resources/orders
curl $URL/coffee-shop/resources/orders/<order-uuid>
----


=== 12 factors

The https://12factor.net/[12 factors^] of modern software-as-a-service applications describe what aspects developers should take into account.
Have a look at the described factors and contemplate, where we've already covered these aspects by using Enterprise Java with cloud-native technologies.
With MicroProfile and its programming model, combined with Docker and Kubernetes, we can easily build 12-factor microservices.
We'll discuss the impact of the 12 factors together.

Now, we've setup a Kubernetes environment that orchestrates our microservices.
Let's see how we can integrate Istio in the link:04-istio.adoc[next section].
