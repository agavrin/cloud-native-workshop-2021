== Prerequisites

As prerequisites to perform the workshop, you need to have the following tools installed on your laptop:

- Any JDK version 8 or later, e.g. https://adoptopenjdk.net/?variant=openjdk8&jvmVariant=openj9
- https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi[Maven 3^]
- https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git[git^]
- https://curl.haxx.se/download.html[curl^] (should exist on most environments already)
- https://docs.docker.com/install/[docker^]
- https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl/[kubectl^]
- https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/home/tools[IBM Cloud CLI^], including plugins kubernetes-service and container-registry

=== Verify

To verify, run the following commands in your terminal (or on the VM provided to you by the workshop administrator):
- `git version`

- `curl -iL https://www.ibm.com`

- `docker run --rm hello-world`

- `kubectl version` (client version is relevant)

- `istioctl version` (client version is relevant)

=== IBM Cloud access

==== Registering IBM Cloud Account

Open a browser window and navigate to https://cloud.ibm.com/registration.

image::images/registration.jpg[Registration page]

Fill in the registration form and paste the code from the validation email when it arrives.

image::images/email.jpg[Validation email]

Then you can https://cloud.ibm.com/login[Login into IBM Cloud^] using the account credentials you have registered.

NOTE: IBM Cloud offers a Free Kubernetes cluster type that will run for 30 days at no costs.
You can use this type once you have entered your credit card or a corresponding promo code.


==== IBM Cloud CLI

We log into the IBM Cloud CLI tool: `ibmcloud login`.
Or you may use browser token to login, for that include the `--sso` flag: `ibmcloud login --sso`.

Create an API key to access the IBM Cloud CLI more conveniently.

----
ibmcloud iam api-key-create mycluster-free-starter \
  -d "cloud-native-starter" \
  --file cloud-native-starter.json
cat cloud-native-starter.json
----

Write down the API key under the `apikey` property.

Now we set the locale and unset any configuration that might exist if you have used the CLI in the past:

----
ibmcloud config --locale en_US
ibmcloud config --check-version=false
ibmcloud api --unset
ibmcloud api https://cloud.ibm.com
ibmcloud login --apikey <yourkey> -r eu-de
----

To verify that the plugins are installed properly, run `ibmcloud plugin list`.
The Container Service plugin and Registry plugin are displayed as `container-service/kubernetes-service` and `container-registry`.


=== IBM Kubernetes Service

Now we create our Kubernetes cluster (free or standard) using the https://cloud.ibm.com/kubernetes/catalog/create[Cloud Console^] or CLI.
A free cluster is sufficient for this workshop but feel free to create a standard cluster with your desired configuration.

If you want to use the CLI continue with one of the following:

For a Free cluster use the following command to create cluster (IF YOU DO NOT HAVE CLUSTER CREATED YET VIA BROWSER):

----
ibmcloud ks cluster create classic  \
  --name mycluster-free
----

For a standard cluster, in standard setting with 3 workers, use the following command:

----
ibmcloud ks cluster create classic \
  --name mycluster-free \
  --zone fra02 \
  --flavor b3c.4x16 \
  --workers 3
----

NOTE: If the command fails because you have existing VLANs in that zone, you need to specify the VLANs in your command:
----
ibmcloud ks vlans --zone fra02
ibmcloud ks cluster create classic \
  --name mycluster-free \
  --zone fra02 \
  --flavor b3c.4x16 \
  --workers 3 \
  --private-vlan <vlan> \
  --public-vlan <vlan>
----


==== Accessing the cluster

Now, we'll see how to set the context to work with our clusters by using the `kubectl` CLI, access the Kubernetes dashboard, and gather basic information about our cluster.

List the available clusters: `ibmcloud ks clusters`.
This command should now show your cluster which is being created.


After the cluster is up-and-running, download the configuration file and certificates for the cluster using the `cluster config` command:

----
ibmcloud ks cluster config --cluster mycluster-free
----

Get basic information about the cluster and its worker nodes.
This information can help you managing the cluster and troubleshoot issues.

Get the details of your cluster: `ibmcloud ks cluster get --cluster mycluster-free`

Verify the nodes in the cluster:

----
ibmcloud ks workers --cluster mycluster-free
kubectl get nodes
----

View the currently available services, deployments, and pods:

----
kubectl get svc,deploy,po --all-namespaces
----

==== Installing Istio

Now, we're installing Istio:

----
istioctl manifest apply --set profile=demo
----

This will install Istio.

Check that all pods are running before continuing.

----
kubectl get pod -n istio-system
----

Install addons (distributed tracing, Grafana monitoring, and Kiali):
----
cd /opt/istio-1.9.4/
kubectl apply -f samples/addons
kubectl rollout status deployment/kiali -n istio-system
----

We can verify our Istio installation as follows:

----
cd ~
istioctl manifest generate --set profile=demo > generated-manifest.yaml
istioctl verify-install -f generated-manifest.yaml
----

The result of the second command (last 3 lines) looks like this:

----
Checked 23 crds
Checked 9 Istio Deployments
Istio is installed successfully
----

We then enable the automatic sidecar injection:

----
kubectl label namespace default istio-injection=enabled
----

This will enable automatic sidecar injection for the `default` namespace.

Congratulations! We now successfully installed Istio into our cluster.


==== Container Registry

In order to build and distribute Docker images, we need a Docker registry.
We can use the IBM Container Registry which can be accessed right away from our Kubernetes cluster.

We log into the Container Registry service via the `ibmcloud` CLI and obtain the information about our registry:

----
ibmcloud cr login
ibmcloud cr region-set eu-central
ibmcloud cr region
You are targeting region 'eu-central', the registry is 'de.icr.io'.
----

We use the CLI to create a unique namespace in the Container Registry service (`cr`) for our workshop:

----
export NAME=<your-name>
ibmcloud cr namespace-add cee-$NAME-workshop
ibmcloud cr namespaces
----

In order to test our new registry namespace, we pull a public image, re-tag it for our own registry, for our region, and push it:

----
docker pull hello-world
docker tag hello-world de.icr.io/cee-$NAME-workshop/hello-world:1
docker push de.icr.io/cee-$NAME-workshop/hello-world:1
----

Let's see whether our image is now in the private registry:

----
ibmcloud cr images
----

NOTE: In all following examples, you will need to adapt the image / namespace name!
This is important to take into consideration, otherwise the examples won't work since the images won't exist in your account.

=== Local Docker setup

If you want to try out the example locally, you have to create a Docker network similar to the following:

----
docker network create dkrnet
----

Now, we've finished all preparations.
Let's get started with the link:01-introduction.adoc[workshop].
